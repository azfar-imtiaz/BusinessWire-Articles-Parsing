(NYSE:VSM), a leading specialty materials supplier to the semiconductor industry, and Entegris, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENTG), a leader in specialty chemicals and advanced materials solutions for the microelectronics industry, today issued the following letter to Versum and Entegris shareholders reiterating the powerful value-creation potential and compelling strategic benefits of the previously announced merger of equals:\n\nMarch 8, 2019\n\nDear Versum and Entegris Shareholders:\n\nWe are writing to you on behalf of the Versum Materials and Entegris management teams and Boards of Directors regarding the merger of equals between our two companies we announced on January 28, 2019. We believe it is important to set the record straight about the compelling strategic benefits the combined company will have as a premier specialty materials company and reiterate our confidence in the significant shareholder value we will deliver as one company. Key points are as follows:\n\nThe Entegris-Versum transaction is a true, all-stock, remain-invested, merger of equals that has tremendous upside value-creation potential. In a combination with Entegris, Versum shareholders will achieve significant value creation from the strength of the combined company, outsized revenue growth and cash flow generation, and enhanced capital returns. Given the leadership position the combined company will hold in the semiconductor and specialty chemicals industry, the combined company will retain the ability to pursue a full range of additional value-creating strategic options going forward.\n\nIn a combination with Entegris, Versum shareholders will achieve significant value creation from the strength of the combined company, outsized revenue growth and cash flow generation, and enhanced capital returns. Given the leadership position the combined company will hold in the semiconductor and specialty chemicals industry, the combined company will retain the ability to pursue a full range of additional value-creating strategic options going forward. There is significant cost, revenue and tax synergy potential within the proposed combination of Entegris and Versum. The integration teams of both companies have worked closely over the past month, and as a result of those detailed efforts, the combined company now expects to achieve more than $125 million in cost synergies from SG&A, such as facilities optimization, administrative functions and rationalization of public company costs, as well as efficiencies in commercial operations, manufacturing, logistics and procurement. Given the strength of the two companies, the enhanced offerings and the positive receptivity from customers, over the next three years we also expect revenue synergies to contribute at least $50 million of additional EBITDA annually. Revenue synergies will result initially from cross-selling across major customers and geographies and eventually through the opportunity to develop co-optimized products and solutions. In addition, the combination is expected to generate tax synergies reflecting the combined company\u2019s ability to benefit from Entegris\u2019 more efficient tax structure.\n\nThe integration teams of both companies have worked closely over the past month, and as a result of those detailed efforts, the combined company now expects to achieve more than $125 million in cost synergies from SG&A, such as facilities optimization, administrative functions and rationalization of public company costs, as well as efficiencies in commercial operations, manufacturing, logistics and procurement.

The combined company will have a strong balance sheet and will generate significant excess free cash flow that will provide the flexibility necessary to allow for significant return of capital to shareholders, among other initiatives. We expect the combined company to have significant debt capacity with gross leverage at closing of only approximately 1.7x.\n\nWe expect the combined company to have significant debt capacity with gross leverage at closing of only approximately 1.7x. Importantly, both companies have experienced management teams with strong track records of successfully integrating mergers, achieving synergies and creating shareholder value. At Entegris, Bertrand Loy has led the successful integration of multiple acquisitions, including Mykrolis, POCO Graphite, and ATMI. Seifi Ghasemi has a proven track record of delivering shareholder value at multiple companies, including Rockwood Holdings and Air Products. We are confident the combined company will meet or exceed the newly stated cost synergy goals as well as realize the other benefits of this merger.\n\nAt Entegris, Bertrand Loy has led the successful integration of multiple acquisitions, including Mykrolis, POCO Graphite, and ATMI.
