(NYSE: GG, TSX: G) (Goldcorp)). The Company\u2019s previously announced combination with Goldcorp represents a superior value creation opportunity to generate long-term value through an unmatched portfolio of world class operations, projects, exploration opportunities, reserves and talent.\n\n\u201cOur thorough review of Barrick\u2019s unsolicited proposal and its associated risks has reaffirmed our conclusion that the combination of Newmont and Goldcorp represents the best opportunity to create value for Newmont\u2019s shareholders and deliver industry-leading returns for decades to come,\u201d said Gary Goldberg, Newmont\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. \u201cUnlike Barrick, Newmont Goldcorp will be centered in the world\u2019s most favorable mining jurisdictions and gold districts. The combination with Goldcorp is significantly more accretive to Newmont\u2019s shareholders on all relevant metrics compared to Barrick\u2019s proposal, even when factoring in Barrick\u2019s own synergy estimates. Realizing value through Barrick\u2019s proposal for Newmont\u2019s shareholders hinges entirely on a new management team that lacks global operating experience and is only two months into its own transformational integration.\u201d\n\nNewmont Goldcorp Combination Represents Superior Value Creation Opportunity Over Barrick\u2019s Proposal\n\nThe Newmont Board of Directors\u2019 unanimous determination that the combination with Goldcorp represents a superior value creation opportunity over Barrick\u2019s unsolicited proposal is based on the following:\n\nThe Goldcorp transaction generates twice the accretion to Newmont\u2019s Net Asset Value (NAV) per share compared to Barrick\u2019s proposal, even when factoring in Barrick\u2019s unsubstantiated synergy assumptions.\n\nBarrick\u2019s proposal is four percent (4%) dilutive to Newmont\u2019s NAV per share, before any synergies. i\n\nThe value creation claimed in Barrick\u2019s proposal relies entirely on the delivery of synergies from a management team that lacks global operating experience and is only two months into its integration effort with Randgold Resources Ltd.\n\nBarrick\u2019s portfolio includes numerous unfavorable and high-risk jurisdictions with several ongoing and significant operational and sustainability problems.\n\nBy contrast, Newmont Goldcorp\u2019s assets will be located in favorable mining jurisdictions and prolific gold districts on four continents.\n\nCompleting the Newmont transaction with Goldcorp does not preclude Newmont or Barrick from achieving the available synergies in Nevada through a joint venture and may permit them to be realized sooner.\n\nBecause Newmont\u2019s Board determined that the Barrick proposal is not a \u201cNewmont Superior Proposal\u201d under the Goldcorp arrangement agreement, Newmont is prohibited under the provisions of that agreement from engaging with Barrick in relation to its proposal.\n\nProposed Nevada Joint Venture with Barrick\n\nTo realize the savings from Newmont\u2019s and Barrick\u2019s Nevada-related operations, Newmont today submitted a joint venture proposal to Barrick. The terms of the proposal are modeled on similar terms to other successful joint ventures, including ones that Barrick has with Newmont and Goldcorp.\n\nMr. Goldberg continued, \u201cNewmont has consistently expressed to Barrick that we are open to a joint venture for our operations in Nevada. In that regard, today we have submitted a term sheet to Barrick proposing a Nevada joint venture. This proposal would enable both companies\u2019 shareholders to realize the available synergies while avoiding the significant risks and complexities associated with Barrick\u2019s unsolicited proposal.\u201d\n\nKey terms of the joint venture proposal to combine the Nevada-related operations of Newmont Goldcorp and Barrick include:\n\nEconomic Interests : Barrick to hold an economic interest equal to 55 percent and Newmont Goldcorp to hold a 45 percent economic interest. The proposed economic interests are based upon analyst consensus Net Present Values for each company\u2019s Nevada-related assets and an equal split of Barrick\u2019s estimated Nevada synergies.\n\n: Barrick to hold an economic interest equal to 55 percent and Newmont Goldcorp to hold a 45 percent economic interest. The proposed economic interests are based upon analyst consensus Net Present Values for each company\u2019s Nevada-related assets and an equal split of Barrick\u2019s estimated Nevada synergies. Governance: Newmont Goldcorp and Barrick will have an equal number of representatives on the Management and Technical Committees. Decisions by the Management Committee shall be determined by majority vote, with the voting power of the parties\u2019 representatives based on their respective economic interests, subject to a list of customary material matters requiring joint approval. The proposed joint venture\u2019s Operational Management will be jointly appointed by both parties and will be responsible for day-to-day operations.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that Newmont\u2019s demonstrated technical expertise and consistent execution will be critical in realizing the synergy opportunities of the proposed joint venture,\u201d said Tom Palmer, Newmont\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer.\n\nNewmont Goldcorp\n\nNewmont has also filed an updated investor presentation regarding the compelling value creation opportunity of the Newmont Goldcorp transaction. Newmont\u2019s proposed combination with Goldcorp is expected to close in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nOn day one after the transaction closes, Newmont Goldcorp will:\n\nBe accretive to Newmont\u2019s NAV per share by 27 percent and 34 percent accretive to 2020 cash flow per share; i\n\nBegin delivering a combined $365 million in expected annual pre-tax synergies, supply chain efficiencies and Full Potential improvements representing the opportunity to create $4.4 billion in Net Present Value (pre-tax); ii\n\nTarget 6-7 million ounces of steady-state gold production over a decades-long time horizon; i\n\nHave the largest gold Reserves and Resources in the gold sector, including on a per share basis;\n\nBe located in favorable mining jurisdictions and prolific gold districts on four continents;\n\nDeliver the highest dividend among senior gold producers; iii\n\nOffer financial flexibility and an investment-grade balance sheet to advance the most promising projects generating a targeted Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of at least 15 percent; iv\n\nFeature a deep bench of accomplished business leaders and high-performing technical teams and other talent with extensive mining industry experience; and\n\nMaintain industry leadership in environmental, social and governance performance.\n\nNewmont today sent the following letter to Barrick\u2019s Executive Chairman, John L. Thornton, and President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Bristow:\n\nNewmont Mining\n\nCorporation 6363 South\n\nFiddlers Green Circle\n\nGreenwood Village, CO\n\n80111\n\nT (303) 863-7414\n\nF (303) 837-5837\n\nwww.newmont.com\n\nMarch 4, 2019\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nBARRICK GOLD CORPORATION\n\nTD Canada Trust Tower 161 Bay\n\nStreet, Suite 3700\n\nToronto, ON M5J 2S1 Canada\n\nAttn.: John L. Thornton, Executive Chairman Mark Bristow, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear John and Mark:\n\nRe: February 25, 2019 Letter\n\nOur board of directors and senior management, with the assistance of our advisors, have undertaken an intensive and detailed review and analysis of your February 25, 2019 letter proposing to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Newmont Mining Corporation. Consistent with its focus on the best interests of our company and its stakeholders and on maximizing stockholder value for the long-term, our board has determined that the proposal set forth in your letter does not constitute, and would not reasonably be expected to constitute, a Newmont Superior Proposal (as such term is defined in the arrangement agreement dated January 14, 2019 between Newmont and Goldcorp Inc., as amended on February 19, 2019). Accordingly, Newmont is not permitted to engage in discussions and negotiations with Barrick Gold Corporation with respect to its proposal, nor are such actions required by the fiduciary duties of our board of directors. Therefore, in accordance with our contractual obligations under the Goldcorp arrangement agreement and consistent with our judgment as to the best interests of Newmont\u2019s stockholders, we will proceed with our transaction with Goldcorp. We believe that transaction provides greater value to the Newmont stockholders and is superior from the perspective of Newmont\u2019s other stakeholders.\n\nWe believe that the transaction you are proposing would reduce, rather than enhance, Newmont stockholder value. Your \u201cat market\u201d proposal is at a material discount to current market values, and any potential value creation depends entirely on Barrick\u2019s execution. Since previous merger discussions terminated in 2014, Newmont has significantly outperformed Barrick on almost every metric. Our management team has a consistent, long-standing track record of delivering superior execution (including productivity improvements and cost reduction measures) through a proven, scalable operating model and deep bench strength supporting thoughtful and structured succession planning. In contrast, Barrick\u2019s underperformance highlights its ineffective operating model, poor record on delivering stockholder returns, and significant jurisdictional risk. The basis for our board\u2019s determinations have been and will continue to be detailed in our public disclosures.\n\nThe value creation of Barrick\u2019s proposal relies entirely upon the delivery of synergies from a management team that was put in place just two months ago. This new team has never managed a global portfolio the size of Barrick, let alone the size of a potential Newmont and Barrick combination. From a stockholder perspective, how a company conducts its business is an important component of value. In addition to compelling economic performance, Newmont has maintained industry leadership in environmental, social and governance performance and, unlike Barrick and Randgold Resources Ltd., has generally avoided material operational, governmental and investment pitfalls. Moreover, Newmont is committed to strong governance practices and has been recognized for having a culture that values responsible corporate citizenship, inclusion and diversity. Barrick\u2019s expressed disdain for process and oversight, and its absence of diversity of leadership, including in its board room, runs contrary to the expressed values of Newmont, our employees, our stockholders and our other valued stakeholders. For all of these reasons, we strongly believe that our stockholders are far better off as owners of Newmont Goldcorp Corporation than as holders of a minority stake in Barrick, a far less attractive entity.\n\nWe recognize that there are value-creation opportunities available in Nevada if we work together. We have always been, and we remain, prepared to explore these opportunities, despite your public comments to the contrary. Achieving these opportunities does not require Newmont to be acquired by Barrick, and for our stockholders to be exposed to the many risks inherent in Barrick. To facilitate the realization of the potential synergies, we are providing you with a term sheet for a joint venture that would combine our Nevada operations and create value for both sets of stockholders. We are prepared to move forward with you on this basis expeditiously.\n\nOur board of directors, our management team and our thousands of employees around the world are dedicated to creating value for all of our stockholders and that is exactly what we will continue to do by executing on our strategic plan and completing our pending transaction with Goldcorp.\n\nOn behalf of our board of directors,\n\nNoreen Doyle\n\nChair\n\nGary J. Goldberg\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nAdvisors and counsel\n\nIn connection with the transaction, Newmont has retained BMO Capital Markets, Citi and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, Goodmans LLP, and White & Case LLP as legal counsel.\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nNewmont will host a conference call and a webcast on Monday, March 4, 2019 at 9:00 AM Eastern Time. Presentation slides will accompany the live webcast and can be accessed on the Newmont website, www.newmont.com and https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/1952473/C5AC3067BE6C7740A2D324BE629DA649.\n\nConference Call Details Dial-In Number 1-855-209-8210 Intl Dial-In Number 1-412-317-5213 Canada Toll Free Conference Name 1-855-669-9658 Newmont Mining Replay Number 1-877-344-7529 Intl Replay Number 1-412-317-0088 Replay Access Code 10129346\n\nAbout Newmont\n\nNewmont is a leading gold and copper producer.

See cautionary statement above regarding forward-looking statements. Forward-looking information representing post-closing expectations is inherently uncertain. Estimates such as expected accretion, NAV, Net Present Value creation, synergies, expected future production, IRR, financial flexibility and balance sheet strength are preliminary in nature. There can be no assurance that the proposed transaction will close or that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate.\n\nii Net Present Value (NPV) creation as used in this release is a management estimate provided for illustrative purposes, and should not be considered a GAAP or non-GAAP financial measure. NPV creation represents management\u2019s combined estimate of pre-tax synergies, supply chain efficiencies and Full Potential improvements, as a result of the proposed transaction that have been monetized and projected over a twenty year period for purposes of the estimation, applying a discount rate of 5 percent. Such estimates are necessarily imprecise and are based on numerous judgments and assumptions. Expected NPV creation is a \u201cforward-looking statement\u201d subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual value creation to differ from expected value creation.\n\niii 2019 dividends beyond Q1 2019 have not yet been approved or declared by the Board of Directors. Management\u2019s expectations with respect to future dividends or annualized dividends are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws.

The Board of Directors reserves all powers related to the declaration and payment of dividends. Consequently, in determining the dividend to be declared and paid on the common stock of the Company, the Board of Directors may revise or terminate the payment level at any time without prior notice. As a result, investors should not place undue reliance on such statements.\n\niv IRR targets on projects are calculated using an assumed $1,200 gold price.", "title": "Newmont Board Unanimously Determines that Barrick\u2019s Unsolicited, Negative Premium Proposal Is Not in Newmont Shareholders\u2019 Best Interests", "images": ["https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20190304005438/en/708631/2/Newmont_Logo.jpg", "https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20190304005438/en/708631/23/Newmont_Logo.jpg"], "text": "\n\n![Business Wire](/images/bwlogo_extreme.png)\n\n# Newmont Board Unanimously Determines that Barrick\u2019s Unsolicited, Negative\nPremium Proposal Is Not in Newmont Shareholders\u2019 Best Interests\n\n Goldcorp Combination Represents Superior Value Creation Opportunity \n Barrick\u2019s Proposal Presents Significant Risks to Newmont Shareholders \n Provides Term Sheet for Nevada Joint Venture with Barrick to Realize Synergies \n Files Investor Presentation Responding to Barrick Claims and Providing Long-Term Outlook for Newmont Goldcorp \n Company to Host Conference Call at 9:00 AM ET \n\nMarch 04, 2019 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time\n\nDENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) (Newmont or\nthe Company) today announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously\ndetermined that Barrick Gold Corporation\u2019s (Barrick) (NYSE: GOLD) (TSX: ABX)\nunsolicited, all-stock negative premium proposal to acquire Newmont is not in\nthe best interests of Newmont\u2019s shareholders.\n\n> After a comprehensive review conducted in consultation with its financial\nand legal advisors, Newmont\u2019s Board unanimously concluded that Barrick\u2019s\nproposal does not constitute, and would not reasonably be expected to\nconstitute, a Newmont Superior Proposal (as such term is defined in the\narrangement agreement between Newmont and Goldcorp Inc.

In that regard,\ntoday we have submitted a term sheet to Barrick proposing a Nevada joint\nventure. This proposal would enable both companies\u2019 shareholders to realize\nthe available synergies while avoiding the significant risks and complexities\nassociated with Barrick\u2019s unsolicited proposal.\u201d\n\nKey terms of the joint venture proposal to combine the Nevada-related\noperations of Newmont Goldcorp and Barrick include:\n\n Economic Interests : Barrick to hold an economic interest equal to 55 percent and Newmont Goldcorp to hold a 45 percent economic interest.

Decisions by the Management Committee shall be determined by majority vote, with the voting power of the parties\u2019 representatives based on their respective economic interests, subject to a list of customary material matters requiring joint approval. The proposed joint venture\u2019s Operational Management will be jointly appointed by both parties and will be responsible for day-to-day operations. \n\n\u201cWe are confident that Newmont\u2019s demonstrated technical expertise and\nconsistent execution will be critical in realizing the synergy opportunities\nof the proposed joint venture,\u201d said Tom Palmer, Newmont\u2019s President and Chief\nOperating Officer.\n\nNewmont Goldcorp\n\nNewmont has also filed an updated investor presentation regarding the\ncompelling value creation opportunity of the Newmont Goldcorp transaction.\nNewmont\u2019s proposed combination with Goldcorp is expected to close in the\nsecond quarter of 2019.\n\nOn day one after the transaction closes, Newmont Goldcorp will:\n\n Be accretive to Newmont\u2019s NAV per share by 27 percent and 34 percent accretive to 2020 cash flow per share; i\n Begin delivering a combined $365 million in expected annual pre-tax synergies, supply chain efficiencies and Full Potential improvements representing the opportunity to create $4.4 billion in Net Present Value (pre-tax);ii\n Target 6-7 million ounces of steady-state gold production over a decades-long time horizon;i\n Have the largest gold Reserves and Resources in the gold sector, including on a per share basis; \n Be located in favorable mining jurisdictions and prolific gold districts on four continents; \n Deliver the highest dividend among senior gold producers;iii\n Offer financial flexibility and an investment-grade balance sheet to advance the most promising projects generating a targeted Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of at least 15 percent;iv\n Feature a deep bench of accomplished business leaders and high-performing technical teams and other talent with extensive mining industry experience; and \n Maintain industry leadership in environmental, social and governance performance. \n\nNewmont today sent the following letter to Barrick\u2019s Executive Chairman, John\nL.

Thornton, Executive Chairman \n---|---|---|---|--- \n| | | | Mark Bristow, President and Chief Executive Officer \n \nDear John and Mark:\n\nRe: February 25, 2019 Letter\n\nOur board of directors and senior management, with the assistance of our\nadvisors, have undertaken an intensive and detailed review and analysis of\nyour February 25, 2019 letter proposing to acquire all of the outstanding\nshares of common stock of Newmont Mining Corporation. Consistent with its\nfocus on the best interests of our company and its stakeholders and on\nmaximizing stockholder value for the long-term, our board has determined that\nthe proposal set forth in your letter does not constitute, and would not\nreasonably be expected to constitute, a Newmont Superior Proposal (as such\nterm is defined in the arrangement agreement dated January 14, 2019 between\nNewmont and Goldcorp Inc., as amended on February 19, 2019). Accordingly,\nNewmont is not permitted to engage in discussions and negotiations with\nBarrick Gold Corporation with respect to its proposal, nor are such actions\nrequired by the fiduciary duties of our board of directors. Therefore, in\naccordance with our contractual obligations under the Goldcorp arrangement\nagreement and consistent with our judgment as to the best interests of\nNewmont\u2019s stockholders, we will proceed with our transaction with Goldcorp. We\nbelieve that transaction provides greater value to the Newmont stockholders\nand is superior from the perspective of Newmont\u2019s other stakeholders.\n\nWe believe that the transaction you are proposing would reduce, rather than\nenhance, Newmont stockholder value. Your \u201cat market\u201d proposal is at a material\ndiscount to current market values, and any potential value creation depends\nentirely on Barrick\u2019s execution. Since previous merger discussions terminated\nin 2014, Newmont has significantly outperformed Barrick on almost every\nmetric. Our management team has a consistent, long-standing track record of\ndelivering superior execution (including productivity improvements and cost\nreduction measures) through a proven, scalable operating model and deep bench\nstrength supporting thoughtful and structured succession planning. In\ncontrast, Barrick\u2019s underperformance highlights its ineffective operating\nmodel, poor record on delivering stockholder returns, and significant\njurisdictional risk. The basis for our board\u2019s determinations have been and\nwill continue to be detailed in our public disclosures.\n\nThe value creation of Barrick\u2019s proposal relies entirely upon the delivery of\nsynergies from a management team that was put in place just two months ago.\nThis new team has never managed a global portfolio the size of Barrick, let\nalone the size of a potential Newmont and Barrick combination. From a\nstockholder perspective, how a company conducts its business is an important\ncomponent of value. In addition to compelling economic performance, Newmont\nhas maintained industry leadership in environmental, social and governance\nperformance and, unlike Barrick and Randgold Resources Ltd., has generally\navoided material operational, governmental and investment pitfalls. Moreover,\nNewmont is committed to strong governance practices and has been recognized\nfor having a culture that values responsible corporate citizenship, inclusion\nand diversity. Barrick\u2019s expressed disdain for process and oversight, and its\nabsence of diversity of leadership, including in its board room, runs contrary\nto the expressed values of Newmont, our employees, our stockholders and our\nother valued stakeholders. For all of these reasons, we strongly believe that\nour stockholders are far better off as owners of Newmont Goldcorp Corporation\nthan as holders of a minority stake in Barrick, a far less attractive entity.\n\nWe recognize that there are value-creation opportunities available in Nevada\nif we work together. We have always been, and we remain, prepared to explore\nthese opportunities, despite your public comments to the contrary. Achieving\nthese opportunities does not require Newmont to be acquired by Barrick, and\nfor our stockholders to be exposed to the many risks inherent in Barrick. To\nfacilitate the realization of the potential synergies, we are providing you\nwith a term sheet for a joint venture that would combine our Nevada operations\nand create value for both sets of stockholders. We are prepared to move\nforward with you on this basis expeditiously.\n\nOur board of directors, our management team and our thousands of employees\naround the world are dedicated to creating value for all of our stockholders\nand that is exactly what we will continue to do by executing on our strategic\nplan and completing our pending transaction with Goldcorp.\n\nOn behalf of our board of directors,\n\nNoreen Doyle \n _Chair_\n\nGary J. Goldberg \n _Chief Executive Officer_\n\nAdvisors and counsel\n\nIn connection with the transaction, Newmont has retained BMO Capital Markets,\nCiti and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &\nKatz, Goodmans LLP, and White & Case LLP as legal counsel.\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nNewmont will host a conference call and a webcast on Monday, March 4, 2019 at\n9:00 AM Eastern Time.

See cautionary statement above\nregarding forward-looking statements. Forward-looking information representing\npost-closing expectations is inherently uncertain. Estimates such as expected\naccretion, NAV, Net Present Value creation, synergies, expected future\nproduction, IRR, financial flexibility and balance sheet strength are\npreliminary in nature. There can be no assurance that the proposed transaction\nwill close or that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate.\n\nii Net Present Value (NPV) creation as used in this release is a management\nestimate provided for illustrative purposes, and should not be considered a\nGAAP or non-GAAP financial measure. NPV creation represents management\u2019s\ncombined estimate of pre-tax synergies, supply chain efficiencies and Full\nPotential improvements, as a result of the proposed transaction that have been\nmonetized and projected over a twenty year period for purposes of the\nestimation, applying a discount rate of 5 percent. Such estimates are\nnecessarily imprecise and are based on numerous judgments and assumptions.\nExpected NPV creation is a \u201cforward-looking statement\u201d subject to risks,\nuncertainties and other factors which could cause actual value creation to\ndiffer from expected value creation.\n\niii 2019 dividends beyond Q1 2019 have not yet been approved or declared by\nthe Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors reserves all\npowers related to the declaration and payment of dividends. Consequently, in\ndetermining the dividend to be declared and paid on the common stock of the\nCompany, the Board of Directors may revise or terminate the payment level at\nany time without prior notice.
