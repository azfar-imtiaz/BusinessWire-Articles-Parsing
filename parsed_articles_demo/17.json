(NASDAQ:OKTA), the leading independent provider of identity for the enterprise, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Azuqua, a leader in no-code, cloud-based business application integration and workflow automation. Together, Okta and Azuqua will provide organizations with a neutral, independent control center for automating the business processes and the flow of identities between applications and services for everyone in an organization\u2014 from employees to partners, and customers. The proposed acquisition is expected to close during Okta\u2019s fiscal first quarter, subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions.\n\nAs every company transforms itself into a technology company, the proliferation of apps and services that power the modern business must drive efficiency, innovation and seamless end user experiences across disparate systems. According to Okta\u2019s 2019 Businesses at Work Report, the average Okta customer has 83 cloud apps, and 9% of customers have more than 200 cloud apps. As organizations choose and adopt best-of-breed technologies, they often struggle to make all of their different applications and technologies work together, and to manage them at scale.
