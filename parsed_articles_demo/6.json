(NYSE: VSM), a leading specialty materials supplier to the semiconductor industry, today issued the following statement reiterating its decision to reject Merck KGaA\u2019s (\u201cMerck\u201d) unsolicited and non-binding $48 per share proposal, and reaffirming its commitment to completing the proposed merger of equals transaction with Entegris, Inc. (NASDAQ: ENTG).\n\n\u201c The Versum Board of Directors stands by its analysis that Merck\u2019s unsolicited proposal for Versum is not a Superior Proposal. We believe Merck\u2019s commentary regarding its proposal is misleading, mischaracterizes our independent financial analysis, and confuses an all-stock merger of equals with a change in control transaction,\u201d said Seifi Ghasemi, Chairman of the Versum Board of Directors. \u201c The appropriate comparison is not between Merck\u2019s proposal and the standalone value of Versum, but rather between selling now to Merck based upon their proposal and remaining invested in the combined Entegris-Versum, with participation in the significant expected value creation of the Versum-Entegris merger of equals and the potential for additional value-creating strategic options. We believe Versum\u2019s carefully studied merger with Entegris is the superior strategic and financial combination. Our prior conclusion is further solidified by a number of key value drivers jointly announced by the two companies today including: additional cost synergies, significant revenue synergy upside, savings from tax optimization, and significant additional shareholder value creation potential through utilization of our strong balance sheet at closing.\u201d\n\nVersum-Entegris Transaction Summary\n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, Versum Materials stockholders will receive 1.120 shares of Entegris for each existing Versum Materials share. Upon completion of the merger, Entegris stockholders will own approximately 52.5 percent and Versum Materials stockholders will own approximately 47.5 percent of the combined company. The transaction remains on track to close in the second half of 2019, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of U.S. and international regulatory approvals, and approval by the stockholders of each company. As previously announced, the combined company will retain the Entegris name and will be headquartered in Billerica, Massachusetts, and will maintain a strong operational presence in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nLazard is serving as financial advisor to Versum Materials and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP is serving as legal counsel.\n\nAbout Versum Materials\n\nVersum Materials, Inc.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Versum Materials, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cVersum Materials\u201d) and Entegris, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cEntegris\u201d) control. Statements in this communication regarding Versum Materials, Entegris and the combined company that are forward-looking, including projections as to the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, the impact of the proposed transaction on Versum Materials\u2019 and Entegris\u2019 business and future financial and operating results, the amount and timing of synergies from the proposed transaction, and the closing date for the proposed transaction, are based on management\u2019s estimates, assumptions and projections, and are subject to significant uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond Versum Materials\u2019 and Entegris\u2019 control. These factors and risks include, but are not limited to, (i) weakening of global and/or regional economic conditions, generally or specifically in the semiconductor industry, which could decrease the demand for Versum Materials\u2019 and Entegris\u2019 products and solutions; (ii) the ability to meet rapid demand shifts; (iii) the ability to continue technological innovation and introduce new products to meet customers\u2019 rapidly changing requirements; (iv) the concentrated customer base; (v) the ability to identify, effect and integrate acquisitions, joint ventures or other transactions; (vi) the ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights; (vii) operational, political and legal risks of Versum Materials\u2019 and Entegris\u2019 international operations; (viii) Entegris\u2019 dependence on sole source and limited source suppliers; (ix) the increasing complexity of certain manufacturing processes; (x) raw material shortages and price increases; (xi) changes in government regulations of the countries in which Versum Materials and Entegris operate; (xii) the fluctuation of currency exchange rates; (xiii) fluctuations in the market price of Entegris\u2019 stock; (xiv) the level of, and obligations associated with, Versum Materials\u2019 and Entegris\u2019 indebtedness; and (xv) other risk factors and additional information. In addition, material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements include: the inherent uncertainty associated with financial or other projections; the prompt and effective integration of Entegris\u2019 businesses and the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the proposed transaction; the risk associated with Versum Materials\u2019 and Entegris\u2019 ability to obtain the approval of the proposed transaction by their shareholders required to consummate the proposed transaction and the timing of the closing of the proposed transaction, including the risk that the conditions to the transaction are not satisfied on a timely basis or at all and the failure of the transaction to close for any other reason; the risk that a consent or authorization that may be required for the proposed transaction is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the transaction; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues.
